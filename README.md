# Fraud Detection ML Pipeline (Demo)

This project shows a simple demo of an end-to-end fraud detection machine learning pipeline using:

- Pandas for data processing
- Scikit-learn for model training
- Synthetic transaction data
- Feature engineering
- Train/test split and evaluation

This is a **demo version** based on typical fraud detection workflows (no real-world data).

## Features
- Synthetic dataset creation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- RandomForest model
- Accuracy and confusion matrix

More files will be added soon.
